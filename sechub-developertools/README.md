What is "sechub-developertools" for?
====================================

A collection of some tooling around sechub which is only available for developers and not part of 
a deployment or a client given to users.

__NEVER give those tools to admins or users!__

### 1. Quick and dirty admin client
One of the first things created here is a simple quick and dirty administration client which will reuse parts
from integration test project - e.g. rest api access, url building etc. which is already done there. *So we do not reinvent the wheel...*
