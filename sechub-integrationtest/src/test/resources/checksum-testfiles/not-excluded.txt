# This is a not excluded file
# Windows and Linux zip creation seems to always have problems with CR/LF vs. LF
# But this is not only inside zipped files, but also on content
# To prevent checksum problems on exclusion testing, we use one checksum for windows and one for linux
# So CR/CL does not matter in remaining files
