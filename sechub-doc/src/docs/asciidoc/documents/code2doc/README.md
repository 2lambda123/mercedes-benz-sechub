# About folder "code2doc"

Inside this folder you will find documents which are referenced by source code. E.g. a @Step references one of the documents inside. This folder
will always be the relative start point for documentation references in code!

These documents are normally referenced only by generated parts again and the generated one is included by normal documents.
