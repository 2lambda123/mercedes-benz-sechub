[[sechub-doclink-uc-user-downloads-job-report]]
A user wants to download an executed `{sechub}` job by its given job UUID.

The report standard format will be json, so machine readable. But there is
also the option to download the report as HTML file.

The HTML file and also the JSON will only have a reduced view of the scan
results. Code snippets etc. can be found on the real security products.
