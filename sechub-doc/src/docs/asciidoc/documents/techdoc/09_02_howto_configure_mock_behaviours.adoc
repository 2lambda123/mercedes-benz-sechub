=== Howto configure mock behaviours

The `MockedAdapterSetupService` reads a JSON configfile from file path.

Default file is located at `/sechub-other/mockdata/mockdata_setup.json`

If you want to use another location, use system property defined in
`MockedAdapterSetupService.java` to define another location.

Example:

include::mockdata_setup_example1.adoc[]
