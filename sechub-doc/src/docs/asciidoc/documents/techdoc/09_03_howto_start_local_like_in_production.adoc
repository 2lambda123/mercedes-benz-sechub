=== Howto start a local development server like in production
In most cases its enough to use mocked adapter variants for development.
But sometimes its necessary to start up a local development server using
real security products (e.g. full integration testing etc.)

Launch configuration is described at <<section-develop-use-real-products,Test/Use real products>>.
You should also use same storage as you use in production! So when you are
using a S3 bucket for storage there you should define this as well!
