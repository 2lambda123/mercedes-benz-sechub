=== About build technology

Leading entry point/technology is always `gradle`. So if you want to build something, please look at the
corresponding gradle tasks.

We will use `travis` for a simple continous integration and quick response at
`github.com` but for automated deployment etc. Jenkins is in use with a ready
to use pipeline script (and two custom jobs).
