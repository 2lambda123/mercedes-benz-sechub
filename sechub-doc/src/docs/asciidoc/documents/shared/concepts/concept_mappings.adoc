[[mapping-concept]]
{sechub} needed a way to configure simple configuration values and also
provide a mapping from project names to adapter specific values (see 
<<scan-config-about,Scan config>> )

==== Structure 
To provide this in a very generic way {sechub} does use the `mappings` means
a simple setup of
 
- pattern +
  _(simple key or a regular expression)_
- replacement +
  _(just the value)_
- comment 
  _(describes what this mapping is used for - just for information)_

==== Domain handling
The `Administration` domain will know every mapping and provide the 
corresponding REST API for administrators.

Changes of mappings will be sent from administration domain to other
domains via event bus and a message with ID: <<section-gen-messaging-mapping_configuration_changed,MAPPING_CONFIGURATION_CHANGED>>.

Dedicated message handlers inside other domains will recognize wanted parts and store informatino when
necessary.
