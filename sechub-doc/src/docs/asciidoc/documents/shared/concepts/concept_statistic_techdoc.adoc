Every data which shall be stored as statistic data is send from other domains via domain 
message bus.

Here an short overview about the involved event locations:

plantuml::./diagrams/diagram_statistic_events_overview.puml[]

The database contains

- `STATISTIC_JOB` +
   Inside the table common job statistic data.
   If a job is started multiple times, we have only ONE entry here. The PK is the job uuid. 
   
- `STATISTIC_JOB_EXECUTION` +
   Here the job execution details can be found.
   If a job is started multiple times (restarts) we have multiple table rows.
   The execution uuid from `SecHubExecutionContext` is the primary key here 
   
- `STATISTIC_JOB_EXECUTION_DETAILS` +
   The details contain specific information collected while the job has been executed. +
   For example: Inside the <<section-analytic,analytic>> phase there could be LOC (lines of code) collected, send as event to this domain and
   stored here. The format of the table is very generic: We have `type`, `key` and `value` beside
   the execution uuid which is the FK.
