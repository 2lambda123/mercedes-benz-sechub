[[section-concepts-domain-driven-design]]
To have loose coupling we decided to have an *simple* DDD approach (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design).
To avoid too much complexity but keep the domains clearly separated following was done:

1. Domains do only communicate between each other via EventBus with explicit Domain Messages.
   (see also <<section-architecture-constraints-domain-communication,domain communication constraints>> )
2. Every domain has got it's own data pool. We currently use only *ONE* database. But every
   domain has got it's own Tables! The tables names starting with a string describing domain
   (for example `AUTH_USER` would represent user data for domain authorization...)
3. The "Event Bus" is currently - {sechub} is a self contained system at the moment -
   just a simple Spring injection based publish/subscribe system done simply by implementing Observer pattern. +
   If it becomes necessary to separate {sechub} into different deployment units we must use a "real" 
   event bus - e.g. `KAFKA` and do some refactorings.

NOTE: Developers are able to define meta information inside code to obtain full generated messaging diagrams. +
      +
      See `Technical documentation` for details about documentation generation and how to
      use annotations to establish results.
