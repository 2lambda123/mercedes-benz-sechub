=== Product results
Product results can be either from security products or from reporting products.

For a job different products can be executed, depending on the <<section-concepts-product-execution,execution configuration,>>. After this the results will be stored in database as
dedicated `ProductResult` entries.


When all `normal` products are executed, the special reporting products will be executed - when no
special configured report collector is found, the embedded product: `Sereco` ("SecHub report collector") will used .
