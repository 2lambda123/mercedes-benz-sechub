== Reporting
This chapter describes the different {sechub} reports and how to read them.

At the moment {sechub} only provides job reports and no cumulated reports.
Job reports do only contain information of exact one scan job done by {sechub}.

TIP: If you want to have management summaries you could store downloaded JSON job reports
 , process data and provide those reports by your own - or you wait while this
 becomes part of {sechub}.
  
=== Job reports
With {sechub} users are able to download their scan results for finished project jobs. We provide following 
formats:
 
- HTML +
  human friendly report variant with less details
- JSON +
  as a machine readable format, usable for sechub client to determine to break build. Will also be
  the base for planned development of IDE plugins (`Eclipse`, `IntelliJ`, `VSCode`)

ifdef::techdoc[]
NOTE: If you are interested in technical details/ development situation you can take a look at https://github.com/Daimler/sechub/issues/68. Newer changes
      /additions in report should normally reference this base issue always, so it is a good starting point.

==== HTML 

The main purpose for the HTML report is to have a human friendly report which gives you a fast overview
to your current situation.

* At the left top corner you see a traffic light showing either 
** GREEN
** YELLOW or
** RED.  

===== Example code scan report with yellow traffic light
The next picture shows a report which resulted in yellow traffic light.

At the top of the report you will find the most critical parts - in our example it is only one
yellow finding which is a `Absolute path traversal`.

The entry point for the found vulnerability is the *Line 28* in java class `AsciidocGenerator`.
The data sink (where the path traversal could lead to problems at the end) is ins same class but
at *Line 29*. 

[NOTE]
====
The call hierarchy between entry point and data sink is not shown in HTML reports - reason: This would
overload the report. Even for security mitigations/development changes
it's normally enough to know entry point and data sink + name of finding.  
====

There are other findings (green) which are less problematic. 

TIP: {sechub} client will break your build per default only at a RED traffic light, but you can also
configure client to do this also on color YELLOW. Only Green is always accepted.

===== What about descriptions and mitigation suggestions?
At the moment {sechub} does not contain this inside it's reports, but this feature will come in future

==== JSON  

This is the machine readable report format.

<1> SecHub job UUID
<2> Finding ID inside report
<3> The name of the vulnerability +
     _in our case an `Absolute path traversal` where attackers could try to manipulate path input, so output could contain unwanted content/wrong file (e.g. a passwd file etc.)_ 
<4> The severity of the report +
    _(will be used to calculate the traffic light color)_
<5> Entry point location +
    _in this case the Java class where the potential malicious input starts_
<6> Line number of entry point
<7> Next call hierarchy element +
    _this is the next element of the call hierarchy, means what is called by_
    _entry point with potential malicious content as parameter. This is ongoing_
    _until last entry inside call hierarchy which is the so called "data sink"_
