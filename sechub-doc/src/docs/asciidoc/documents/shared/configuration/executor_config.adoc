=== Executor configuration
{sechub} uses `product executors` to call security products by dedicated `product adapters`.
Each used security product has at least one executor configuration.

Inside such a configuration, we can define properties and parameters which are used when it comes
to {sechub} job execution. The data is evaluated and used by product executors at runtime and no server restart is necessary.

So for example you can easily change a base URL of a product location and it will automatically be
used by next job execution.

[WARNING]
====
`NESSUS` and `NETSPARKER` product executors does currently not use
all properties and parameters but needs still some dedicated ENV entries! But you have
to define a configuration - and a profile - for those products as well!

====

==== Data structure

===== Name
Just the name of the executor configuration. Can be changed

===== Enabled
Only when the executor configuration is enabled, it will be used (of courseit has also
be added to an enabled profile and this to a project).

===== UUID
Unmodifiaable unique ID of an executor configuration. Cannot be changed. 

===== Product identifier
The product identifier for the product executor to use.
Examples are: 

- `CHECKMARX`
- `NESSUS`
- `NETSPARKER`
- `PDS_CODESCAN`
- `PDS_WEBSCAN`
- `PDS_INFRCAN`

===== Executor version
At the moment all product executors exists only in version `1` and as long as there is no
breaking change the exisitng product executor will be extended and the existing version will be kept.

When there are breaking changes - e.g. the communication between {sechub} and a new version of the security
product becomes completely different, or parameters have a complete other meaining, an additional
product executor with another version will be available.

===== Product base URL
Here we define the base URL to the security product including port number.

As an example: `https://checkmarx.example.org:6011`

===== Product credentials 
We need dedicated credentials to communicate/use a security product.

====== User
Just the user name for product. You can either define here the real user 
name or use `env:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLENAME` instead. The environment name
must be set at SecHub server side with origin user name so the server will
store `env:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLENAME` as configuration in database, but will
use the content of environment variable `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLENAME` at 
job execution runtime.

====== Password or API token
Same situation as for user names, described before: Use `env:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLENAME`
to prevent storage of real credentials in database and provide the secret information
at server side as an environment variable.

WARNING: Please use always the `env:ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLENAME` approach  - at least for passwords or api tokens 


===== Parameters
Parameters are used at job execution runtime to setup product adapters and to change security
product behaviours.

====== Mappings
Some product executors do need special mappings - e.g for new project creations. Please look at
<<mapping-technical-details, mapping>> for more details about the
concept and the format. 

====== Key values
It is also possible to provide just dedicated key value parameters.

==== Usecases
Following usecases are supported:

- <<section-usecase-UC_047,UC_047-Admin creates an executor configuration>>

- <<section-usecase-UC_048,UC_048-Admin deletes executor configuration>>

- <<section-usecase-UC_049,UC_049-Admin fetches executor configuration list>>

- <<section-usecase-UC_050,UC_050-Admin fetches executor configuration>>

- <<section-usecase-UC_051,UC_051-Admin updates executor configuration>>

==== Product specific details

===== Checkmarx
====== Mapping teams and presets for new projects
When a user starts a scan and a `checkmarx` project does not already exist, it will be created.
So far so good.

But maybe it is shall not be created with the default Checkmarx "preset" because in some scenarios this is not very suitable
- e.g. when creating many projects, we do not want to assign all presetIds manually to the project.
(A preset is something like a profile in Checkmarx where scope of scan can be defined at project level).

Also there should be an automated assignment to dedicated teams when
the project is new created.
 
This can be done by name pattern providers `checkmarx.newproject.presetid.mapping` and `checkmarx.newproject.teamid.mapping`
as shown in following example:

*An example scan configuration:*

Define mapping with `checkmarx.newproject.presetid`
[[scan-config-example1-checkmarx]]
[source, json]
----
include::scan_config_example1_checkmarx-preset-id.json[]
----
Define mapping with `checkmarx.newproject.teamid`
[[scan-config-example2-checkmarx]]
[source, json]
----
include::scan_config_example2_checkmarx-team-id.json[]
----

On lazy project creation time, depending on project name in sechub, after checkmarx project creation the project will automatically be assigned to the pattern specific presetId.

*For example:*

* project named in sechub with `my-java-project-marvelous1` will have preset id `100021` and teamId `1`.
* project named in sechub with `a-go-project-super-cli` will have preset id `100031` and teamId `2`.
* project named in sechub with `something-else`will have preset id `100001` and teamId `3`

[IMPORTANT]
====
First matching part will be used! So ordering is important!

ifdef::techdoc[]
======= Technical details
Checkmarx install setup does use a dedicated configuration support to provide `presetId` and `teamId` 
to adapter. Adapter will use `presetId` (if defined) and `teamId` _(mandatory as before)_ when 
project creation is necessary
endif::techdoc[]

====== How to obtain preset id
Unfortunately the preset ID is necessary for REST calls, but not
visible at Checkmarx UI.

You can either directly access the DB or inspect the web page by
web tools in you browser (e.g. enable network monitoring and change prest at UI...)  

====== How to obtain team id
Unfortunately the team ID is necessary for REST calls, but not
visible at Checkmarx UI.

You can either directly access the DB or inspect the web page by
web tools in you browser _(e.g. enable network monitoring and change team at UI...)_

==== Examples
NOTE: As long as there is no dedicated Web UI for administration we use the
Developer Admin UI for example screenshots:

For every example you have either to create a new executor configuration or edit an an
existing one.

To edit an existing one, select main menu entry "Edit executor configuration" as shown
in next figure:

image::sechub-daui-config-edit-executor-config-menuentry.png[]

This will result in a selection dialog.

image::sechub-daui-select-executor-config-to-edit.png[width=75%]

===== Checkmarx configuration
At the configuration editor dialog you can change the data structure.
Parameters are inside a simple text field. But there exists also a button "Edit parameters".

image::sechub-daui-checkmarx-executor-config-example.png[width=75%]

When you press the "Edit parameters" button, a dedicated parameter editor will appear:

image::sechub-daui-checkmarx-executor-parameter-editor-mappings-example.png[width=75%]
As you can see the type, the necessarity and a a short description of the parameters are
shown above the text component. This makes it easier to configure values.

At the mapping tab pane you can edit the JSON data. With "Test mapping" button you can also
check if the naming pattern are correct and the expected values are resulting.
 
For the "normal" key value pairs we got the "key/values" tab pane. Here the content is normally
only simple text. For example `checkmarx.fullscan.always` could contain
like "true" or "false" or simply nothing.

image::sechub-daui-checkmarx-executor-parameter-editor-key-values-example.png[width=75%]



===== PDS code scan configuration
Here we got an example for a configuration with selected product identifier `PDS_CODESCAN`:

image::sechub-daui-pds-executor-parameter-editor-key-values-example.png[]

The `pds.config.productidentifier` which is an mandatory value is marked *red* because it must be
sent to PDS server to identify which product shall be used on the other side.

Optional, but wellknown PDS key value pairs are shown in *black* - the parameters `example.key1` and 
`example.key2` are marked *yellow*. Reason: Those keys are unknown by 
SecHub and so normally custom parameters. 
 
===== Sereco configuration
`Sereco` is *the only product which needs no configuration at all*, because it is an embedded "product".


It also needs no profile setup or something else - as long as there is no other reporting product
available/configured for a {sechub} job, an automated fallback will always call `Sereco` at the end to ensure a report
result is created.

But `Sereco` is the one and only exception!
